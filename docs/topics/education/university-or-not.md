# To go or not to go...

Maybe you have just finished high school, or maybe you already have some working experience. Whatever is your current situation, you may have been asking yourself recently if the university is the right path for you or not. After all, this is a big leap that will occupy the next years of your life.<br /><br />

Attending a University may cost **a lot of money** and you may not be able to afford it. It's not just the yearly enrollment, but also books and the travels.<br />
No doubt, a Bachelor or a Master degree can help finding a **well paid job**. Nowdays most entry-level working positions require either a degree or some previous working experience. 

<br /><br />

## Let's be clear...
If your ideal career path is to become a doctor or an engineer, or any field that requires **deep knowledge of math**, **physics**, or **medicine**, then it will almost certainly be out of your league if you don't have a Master Degree.<br /><br />

Overall, when it comes to scientific research, economics and finance, politics and law, the argument will likely be the same.<br />
The tech industry might be a bit more interesting.<br /><br />

### What about software development?

From personal experience, I can tell you that landing a job without a degree is indeed possible, but not easy. To be a software developer you are often asked to acquire some programming skills, as well as understanding of algorithms and design patterns. You should also know how Operating Systems and Computer Networks work, otherwise you may risk to have a really basic grasp of what your job is.<br /><br />

And that's why I'm actually attending a university, because getting low-level information of computer architectures elsewhere is pretty hard and unconvinient.

<br />

## Pros...
Furthermore, a second key advantage is the **social environemt**.<br />
Atteding a university means staying in a class full of other students/people who probably share your same passions or interests.<br /><br />

Some of your **most meaningful friendships**, or **working relationships**, may probably begin there.<br />
After all, Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg and a group of his friends, Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, and they were all attending the Harvard University.<br />

Same thing goes for Google and its founders Larry Page and Sergey Bin, both PhD students at the Standford University.

## Cons...
So all perks are good, alright, but not everything is gold...<br />
Other than being financially and/or time expensive, another reason why you may not go to the University is the **lack of the practical knowledge** often required by companies.<br /><br />

Remember when I said I was attending the University? Well, while I do infact know much more about Computer Science overall, I don't get to write a lot of code, if not on my own (like this exact website ðŸ˜€ ).<br />

Because I already have some (working) experience, my peers, who never worked, may struggle more than me to get a job in the future.<br /><br />

One other thing to consider is the **travelling distance**. You may have to commute for an hour, if not more, to arrive on time for the start of class. To accomplish so, you may need to wake up early every single day.<br />
But in the long run, this situation can be **quite stressful** to most people, because you may not get enough time to sleep, or to spend some time with your friends and relatives.<br /><br />

Some people, in order to pay university fees, might also have to work while studying, which could be an ideal solution, but not always practical.

<br /><br />

## My take...
If you can afford to go to the university then I would suggest to do that. Because it will be an important moment of cultural and human growth.<br /><br />
If you wish to access such a high level of education, but it seems financially unfeasible, then you might have to do more sacrifices and either work while studying to keep some money apart before the enrollment. 
<br /><br />
If you are not sure of the choice, I would suggest trying to talk your friends who are already attending it, to ask them why they took that path, or you could consider what you current skills are and see if they are suitable for a job.<br /><br />

I hope I have cleared some of your doubts and ease your decision, if not, well... sorry to waste your time... ðŸ˜¬<br /><br />

See you!
