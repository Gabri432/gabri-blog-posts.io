First time into programming? Never heard of Java, C# or web development? Afraid of having regrets or making the wrong choice? <strong>Don't worry!</strong><br />
In this blog post I'm going to help you navigating through this amazing yet complex world that is Programming.

<br />

<h2>There is no wrong choice</h2>

Let's start from the big one.<br /> Unless you are looking for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language" target="_blank">Esoteric languages</a>, which programming language you end up choosing will still open plenty of job opportunities. if this is your main concern. 
<br /><br />
By visiting popular work related platforms, like Linkedin and Indeed, you will find <strong>thousands of job offers</strong> for any programming language.<br />
While some language may have more, this won't impact your ability to start a career.<br /><br />
<strong>Every programming language is good</strong>.

<br />

<h2>Forget the difficulty, nothing starts easy</h2>

While I do agree that some programming languages may present a steeper learning curve than others, this shouldn't discourage you from picking the one that seems the most interesting.<br /><br />
The thing is, because you are a beginner, all programming languages would present somewhat of initial challenge due to the fact that you are facing for the first time <strong>new concepts</strong>, new principles, rules and mechanisms related to that language.<br /><br />
The good thing is that <strong>Internet provides a lot of free and detailed educational resources</strong>, such as Youtube tutorials, learning apps, websites such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a> or <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> that will certainly help you in your journey into mastering a programming language.<br /><br />
<strong>Nobody is born a genius, everyone starts somewhere</strong>.

<br /><br />

<h2>How many programming languages?</h2>

Another popular question, or rather concern, is the amount of programming languages. How many of them you should learn?<br />
The more the better right? Well, not really.
<br /><br />
The reality is that every programming language can be so vast and complex that probably one or two would be already a lot.<br />
Knowing one doesn't just mean knowing the syntax and be able to write simple programs, but it is also about being familiar with more advanced concepts such as programming principles, patterns, best practices, and also some libraries or even frameworks.
<br /><br />
That's why most of the times is far more reasonable to <strong>specialize</strong> your knowledge into a single or couple of programming languages.
<br />
Also, while syntax may differ from language to language, some principles and rules, as well as best practices, more often than not, happen to be <strong>common staple stones</strong> that in the long run will eventually ease switching between them.<br /><br />
<strong>Quality over quantity</strong>.

<br /><br />

<h2>Ask Internet, a lot</h2>

Now that we clarify the first real steps, let's get into business. How to choose your first programming language?<br />
As I previously said, Internet provides all the resources and help for all the possible situations.
<br /><br />
If you don't know what programming language to choose there are different considerations to make.
<br />
<strong>Why</strong> are you interested in learning a programming language? Let's say you would like to pursue a career in tech.<br />
You want to become a software developer, but what do you need to do and to know to be one?
<br /><br />
Well, ask Internet! Search online for job offers related to software development, and take a look at the most commonly required programming languages and technologies, or <q><strong>tech-stacks</strong></q>, and then, search for online free content and courses to learn them.
<br />
At least, you will start to have a basic understanding of what the job market needs the most, which may help deciding where to focus the time and resources more.
<br /><br /> 
Let's say instead you are (currently) not looking for a job, but you still think knowing how to use a programming language will come in handy, eventually even for a career.
<br /><br />
Well, ask Internet again! Search for the most popular languages, pick one, and start learning it as previously said.<br />
You may have found names as such Python, JavaScript and Java. All the three are excellent choices, as well many others, like C, C++, C#, Kotlin and so on...
<br /><br />
<strong>Internet is your greatest friend</strong>!

<br /><br />

<h2>Theory vs Practice</h2>

Ok, so you started learning a language, you get used to certain concepts, like variables, functions or methods, data types, loops, conditional statements, error handling and so on... but... hey... what now? When you are going to use them?
<br /><br />
Well, whenever you want to. Apply your concepts step by step, that is, create simple a program, and while you are learning you things, make that program more complex.<br />
There are a lot of cool programs, with different difficulty levels, that you can search online and code on your own to test you programming skills.<br />
They will basically track your progress with a certain language.<br /><br />
For example, create a calculator that can handle the basic math operations, such as sum, substraction, multiplication and division.<br />
Now make it harder by handling user input instead of predefined spaces or constraints, and handle division by zero.<br />
Then, add options to convert to different measurement units, such as between the Imperial System and the Metric System.<br /> 
How far you can get?
<br /><br />
Theory will build solid foundations, that will help recognize ways to improve your programs and making them more secure and efficient.<br />
Practice will help you familiarize with your tools and real world constraints.<br /><br />
<strong>Theory and Practice are not enemies, but close friends</strong>.

<br /><br />

<h2>To sum up</h2>

The path to learn a programming language is exciting and full of rewards, but for any reward there is always a challenge to go through first, but after all, <strong>life is full challenges to face</strong>.
<br /><br />
If real passion and keen curiosity are the ones driving you, then take your time, and eventually, you will cross the <strong>finish line</strong>.
