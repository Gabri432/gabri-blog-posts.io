# Speaking of minimum wage...
<br /><br />

<span class="date"> Date: 15th of May 2024 </span> <br /><br />
In this article I'm going to analyse some critical aspects to consider before a country decides to promulgate it as a law. 

<br />

## How to define a minimum wage
Sounds kind of obvious at first but it is actually quite difficult to set a minimum wage. Here are two main considerations to make:
<ul>
<li><strong>how to set an optimal minimum wage?</strong> High enough to be useful, but too high might be financially unsustainable for a country.</li>
<li><strong>National or Local minimum wage?</strong> What are the pros and cons of both? Is there a way in between?</li>
</ul>

<br />

## A delicate balance
There are three main possibilities that may occur when setting a minimum wage: <br />

<ul>
<li>it is <strong>higher</strong> than the average national wage;</li>
<li>it is <strong>lower</strong> than the average national wage;</li>
<li>it is <strong>in line</strong> with the national wage.</li>
</ul>

<br />

### Scenario 1
The first scenario sounds the most ideal. Because now the average wage must be higher, people will in general have more money. <br />
This could mean an <strong>increase in the purchasing power</strong>, so in the average spending, which may result in an economy growth.
<br /><br />
But the reality is a bit more complicated...
<br /><br />
Due to this increase in the wages, every company will now see an increase in <strong>wage spending</strong>, that could lead in a <strong>reduce hiring</strong>, and even worse an increase in <strong>layoffs</strong>.
<br /><br />
To prevent or counter-balance this event there might be the need to promote tax incentives and/or tax related bonuses, but this may cause a high increase in government spending.
<br/>

### Scenario 2
The second case solves some problems of the first scenario. Companies may be more willing to hire due to decrease in wage spending. If on average more people have jobs, you are effectively reducing poverty. <br />

But of course there is also the possibility of <strong>reducing</strong> the purchasing power for those people whose average wage was higher.<br/>
Companies may have less interest in raising wages to those employees considering they are already payed more than required by law.
<br/>

### Scenario 3
The third scenario is a bit weird. Because such minimum wage already aligns with the average one, the effects of it may not be perceived at all.<br />
It might be actually a way to play safe. For most companies, aligns with such a requirement will be easy, as it does not affect much spendings, but for people, it is still a warranty of a minimum economic level. <br />

This case may suffer less from the problems of the two previous cases.

## Minimum wages?
As a consequence of the aforementioned cases there are also other considerations to make. <br />

Different regions/areas within the same country will have probably different costs of living. <br />
That is, setting a common national minimum wage, while easier to manage, may not be the most ideal solution. <br />

A national-level min wage solves <strong>earning disparities</strong> across the country, but does not solve <strong>spending disparities</strong>. 
This may cause people to internally migrate moving to less expensive areas, if they can afford it. <br />
This can lead to a more even distribution of wealth and population across a country, but it does cost the stress and discomfort of the people. <br /><br />

To solve such issues we could set a region-based min wage. This wage would aling with the cost of living of each area. This case solves spending disparities, but brings back earning disparities. <br /> 
People may still have to move elsewhere if they are looking for a <strong>better pay</strong>.

### Combining the two?
A possible third way might be a combination of the two choises. We may set a national baseline and then apply regional level corrections. <br />
That is, firstly, there is a base pay guaranteed, and secondly, this pay can receive adjustments aligned with the local cost of living. <br />
Still, to avoid huge gaps between regions with extremely opposite incomes, the baseline could start in the middle. <br />

This would avoid lower income areas to apply too huge and financially unfeasible corrections, while still closing the gap with higher income areas.

## Final thoughts
While considering those aspects before implementing such economic maneuver can definetely be really helpful, there is probably another plethora of other details to highlight, such as <strong>inflation</strong>. <br /><br />

What do you think about it?
