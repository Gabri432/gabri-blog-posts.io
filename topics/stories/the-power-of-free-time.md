## The power of free time
<br /><br />
<span class="date">Date: 21th of May 2024</span><br />

We tend to spend more and more time attached to the <strong>phone</strong>.<br />
On average I used to spend more than <strong>4 hours per day</strong> on Youtube and other social media when I have free time.<br />
It may not sound a lot, but if you think about it, those 4 hours per day are 28 hours per week, that is more than a <strong>hole day</strong>!<br />
So recently I decided that I should have used this time in a more productive way.<br />
Here are <strong>4 best things</strong> I know do every day/week, which you might apply too.
<br />

## Learn how to program
The job market is booming with requests for people who know how to code, like web developers and backend developers.<br />
Learning how to program can really open a lot of <strong>job opportunities</strong> for you. But other than that it gives you really powerful tools to do a lot of really cool things. <br /><br />
I remember learning how to code during the covid-19 pandemic, as I explained in this <a href="https://gabri432.github.io/angular-personal-website/blog/stories/this-is-my-story" target="blank" title="Check my blog post 'This is my Story'">article</a>, and being fascinated by the possibility of eventually creating <strong>my own website</strong>, my own space on the internet, as well as potentially a lot of daily useful programs that could help me whenever I need.<br /><br />
If you have a lot of free time that you spend on a phone, consider learning web development, or in general learning how to use a programming language. <br />
Some of the most popular are Python, Java and JavaScript.<br /><br />
You will really feel like you have the <strong>power at your hands</strong>.
<br /><br />

## Learn a new language to speak
Similarly with coding, being able to speak fluently in at least <strong>two languages</strong> can be really helpful for job opportunities.<br />
But aside from that, it gives you also the opportunity to break a language barrier, essentially <strong>unlocking new friendships</strong>, new places to visit in the world, new points of view of the world itself.<br /><br />
I remember starting to study French on a daily/weekly basis during the pandemic and even some months prior to it.<br />
Recently I have even gone as far as creating this <a href="https://gabri432.github.io/angular-language-learner/" target="blank" title="Check my website 'angular-language-learner'">website</a> to improve my french.<br /><br />
While I can still barely speak it, I can quite easily read it (thankfully because it is also close to Italian). I can read newspapers and blog posts in French, and it is fascinating to see how certaing things are viewed and experienced differentely from your native country.<br /><br />
It really helps <strong>understanding the world around you</strong>.

<br /><br />

## Do physical exercise
If there is something that the covid pandemic taught me, is that the real fortune isn't money, but is <strong>not having to go to an hospital</strong>.<br /><br />
Daily exercise is the greatest gift you can do to your body, and you will be thankful in the future, knowing that you won't suffer as easily by diseases as you would.<br />
Exercise isn't just a way to get <strong>stronger physically</strong>, which is still really important, but also <strong>mentally</strong>.<br /><br />
While doing exercise will help you getting more resiliant to injuries, having a more healthy and efficient body, and maybe even becoming more good looking, the idea of setting a daily or weekly program to reach certain goals, the will to embrace <strong>hard work and discipline</strong> before pleasure, will make you a more <strong>responsible and conscious</strong> person.   

## Be bored
Let your <strong>imagination be the source of your entertaiment</strong>, instead of your phone.<br /><br />
I like going for a long walk and engaging in <strong>deep thoughts and conversations</strong> with myself, thinking about what I have accomplished, and what I can still accomplish.<br />
What were the challenges and the difficulties I have faced, and how they <strong>shaped person I am</strong>.<br /><br />
I like to think about how my life could be, could change for the best, for me, my friends and my family.<br />
What can I do for some global issues? Do I have the desire to do something <strong>remarkable</strong>? Will I ever start a political carrier? Or found my own company and making it big? What would be like to have my own kids and wife, in a beautiful house? <br /><br />

Will I still have my passion for coding, my knowledge of french, my health, and my long walks late in life?
