<h1>Why Boom Beach is better than Clash of Clans...</h1> 
<br /><br />
<span class="date">Date: 28th of September 2023.</span><br />

First, I'm not saying that Clash is bad or else. I do like Clash of Clans, infact I still play the game after years I have downloaded it (I'm a proud TH12 village by the way üòÅ).
<br /><br />
That been said... I have been playing Boom Beach for almost as much time, and I can say with confidence that Boom Beach is better than Clash of Clans.

<br />

<h2>Let me explain...</h2>
<h3>More buildings</h3>
Both the games have really good looking villages, but Boom Beach has a wider variety of buildings.
<br /><br />
Other than cannons, towers and mortars, there are rocket launchers, shock launchers, machine guns, shield generators, laser beams, grapplers...
<br />
Boom Beach villages have no walls, which is actually a good thing, because there is far more room for placing buildings.
<br /><br />

<h3>More... villages</h3>
On Boom Beach you can conquer resource bases to increment the production of wood, iron or stone needed for upgrading your buildings. <br />
You cannot directly upgrade resource bases buildings because they will be upgraded after every new re-conquering.
<br /><br />

<h3>More events</h3>
On Boom Beach there are different events happening during the week.
<br /><br />
<table>
<tr>
<td>Monday</td>
<td>Hammerman Strikes Back</td>
<tr>
</tr>
<td>Tuesday</td>
<td>Dr. T Tropico Island</td>
<tr>
</tr>
<td>Wednesday</td>
<td>Dr. T Volcano Island</td>
<tr>
</tr>
<td>Thursday</td>
<td>War Factory</td>
<tr>
</tr>
<td>Friday</td>
<td>Imitation Game</td>
<tr>
</tr>
<td>Saturday</td>
<td>Dr. T Tropico Island</td>
<tr>
</tr>
<td>Sunday</td>
<td>Dr. T Volcano Island</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br /><br />
Other there are also monthly based events, like <a href="https://boombeach.fandom.com/wiki/Warships" target="_blank" title="Warship wiki">Warships</a> and <a href="https://boombeach.fandom.com/wiki/Mega_Crab" target="_blank" title="Mega Crab wiki">Mega Crabs</a>.
<br />

<h3>Statues</h3>
Probably <strong>the coolest aspect</strong> of Boom Beach is the logic of Statues. 
<br /><br />
Statues are objects that give certain perks or bonuses to your village. They are classified in four colours.

<table>
<tr>
<td>Green</td>
<td>Production bonuses: increases gold, wood, stone, iron production.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Red</td>
<td>Troop bonuses: increases health or damage of troops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Blue</td>
<td>Defense bonuses: increases health or damage of buildings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purple</td>
<td>Special bonuses: increases gun-bot energy, victory reward, or chances to get power stones.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br /><br />

<h3>Troops</h3>
On clash of clan every troop that has been deployed to the enemy village will no longer be available (except for heroes), even if it survives.<br />
This is not the case for Boom Beach.
<br /><br />
Boom Beach troops can be reused multiple times as long as they survive in the battlefield.<br />
This allows to play multiple attacks consecutively, without having to wait for all the troops to be ready, if all of them survived.
<br /><br />

<h2>To sum up</h2>
As I said in the beginning, there is <strong>nothing wrong</strong> with Clash of Clans.<br /> 
It is an amazing game that I am still enjoying to play after so many years.<br /> 
But I believe that Boom Beach has a more diversified and rich gameplay, with some really cool mechanics that, at the end of the day, I think they make the game far more interesting.
