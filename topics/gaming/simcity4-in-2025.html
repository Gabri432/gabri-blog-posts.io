<h1>Simcity 4 in 2025?</h1> 
<span class="date">Date: 22th of January 2025.</span><br />

One of the most popular city builder games of all time. In this blog post I will explain why this masterpiece deserve to be played in 2025, 
by exploring both pros and cons.
<br /><br />

<h2>Pros</h2>
For many, this is THE city builder, the one who, without necessarily creating it, defined the entire genre.<br />
Let's analyse what I consider the key ingredients that helped this game to thrive for over 22 years, since its release in 2003. 

<h3>Graphics</h3>
When first loading the game, it opens to the Region view.

While it may not hold up to the modern standards of newer games, I think SimCity 4's graphics still holds up today.<br />
Each city is colorful and attractive to look at, especially as it get larger and displays a wider variety of buildings, such as residential units, 
commercial offices and shops, industrial factories, civic infrastructure, special and famous/historical buildings, with <strong>various architectural styles</strong>.<br />

<h3>Gameplay depth</h3>
It's mind-blowing to see the amount of details put into the game by the developers back then.<br /><br />

The game gives you control over several aspects of city management, such as education, healthcare, transportation, waste collection, police and fire departments,
tax management, and even trade agreements with neighboring cities. <br /><br />
At the same time, the management panel offers views for monitoring various data such as air and water pollution levels, education quality, traffic congestion, 
energy and water production/consumption. This and much more are generated <strong>over time</strong> during the existence of your city.<br />

<h3>U-drive-it Mode</h3>
In my opinion, <strong>a true gem</strong> of the game, is the ability to 
<a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/omnibus/simcity-4/reference/a-review-on-rush-hour-r30/" title="Opens to Simtropolis website">drive a vehicle</a>, 
such as a bus, a police car, a plane, a train, just to name a few, in your city. 
I remember playing in this mode for hours because I was having too much fun being <strong>immersed in the city</strong> I have created. <br />
It was like seeing my metropolis from the same point of view of my citizens. 

<h3>Soundtracks</h3>
I think SimCity 4 has arguably <a href="https://youtu.be/PSv37HwwojU?si=VtcQ6G0kcwfZWLJN"><strong>the best soundtracks</strong></a> in the entirety of the City Builder Games genre. 
Among my favorite ones there are <strong>Landfill</strong>, <strong>Morning Commute</strong>, <strong>Wheels of Progress</strong>, <strong>Night Owl</strong>,
<strong>Rush Hour</strong>, <strong>Oasis</strong> and <strong>Bumper to Bumper</strong>.

<h2>Cons</h2>
Nothing is perfect, and the same goes for SimCity 4.<br /><br />
Compared to modern city builders like <i>Cities: Skylines</i>, there are notable limitations, such as having <strong>streets that cannot curve</strong> or overlap. Infact you can only build cities 
mostly using a grid layout, with streets going either at 45 or 90 deg.<br /><br />

Another aspect is the <strong>limited camera movement</strong>. While Cities: Skylines allows for a 360-degree view of the city, 
SimCity4 only has 4 camera angles, each facing a different 90-degree view (basically a North, West, East or South view).<br /><br />
Speaking of cities, while SimCity4 has regions, each containing several cities, <strong>you can't directly access a city from another one</strong>. 
You will have to exit the view of a specific city to access a new one.<br />

Another limit is that <strong>you can't really build transportation lines</strong> in Simcity 4. Buses and trains basically are used as taxi cars, 
while Cities: Skylines allows for actual bus and train routes.<br />

<h2>To sum up</h2>
SimCity 4 is game that, despite its limitations, can still offer a great gaming experience, that can be improved thanks to online communities such
